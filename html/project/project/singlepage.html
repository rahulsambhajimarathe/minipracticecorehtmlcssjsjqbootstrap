                    I'm a product and web designer from Australia. I enjoy working on product design, design systems, and Webflow projects, but I don't take myself too seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work has been featured on Typewolf, Mindsparkle Magazine, Webflow, Fonts In Use, CSS Winner, httpster, Siteinspire, and Best Website Gallery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a lifelong learner, inconsistent reader, and crappy golfer. I'm currently exploring the world with my partner and a carry-on backpack. At the moment we're in Spain.
                </p>

                    I'm working on himalayas.app with some smart people. It's our love letter to remote work. We're releasing new features via Twitter and on our changelog.

                    In late 2021, I created Untitled UI, the ultimate UI kit and design system for Figma that focuses on quality. This library started as a side project but has grown into the largest and best-selling Figma UI kit in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also created Untitled UI Icons, a clean, consistent, and neutral icon library crafted specifically for modern UI design. This was the #1 Product of the Week on Product Hunt and is now the highest-rated icon library on Gumroad. In 2022, I released two
                    Untitled UI Webflow kits on Relume and Webflow Libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built (and later sold) goodbooks.io, the largest curated collection of 8,500+ book recommendations from some of the most successful and interesting people in the world. This project was the #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt.
                </p>

                    Prior, I was Head of Design @ UpGuard, one of the world’s fastest-growing cyber security startups with customers including NASA, PagerDuty, and the New York Stock Exchange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was the second employee @ Spaceship. Spaceship was the fastest-growing new entrant in the world, growing to $100m in assets and amassing a 50k+ waitlist in 3 months. They're now managing over $1bn in assets. Along the way, I designed pitch decks that
                    raised $40m+ in venture capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve worked with Australian startups that have gone on to raise $180m+ from some of the most notable investors in the world:

                    I don’t have a background in design. This may sound alarming, but I consider a generalist approach an important asset.

                    I studied Management and Finance at UTS, Sydney, before working as an Ops Manager in high-growth startups. This involved learning fast and wearing a lot of hats. In mid-2019, I decided I wanted to pursue design.

                <p>
                    Product design isn't as complicated or as difficult as everyone pretends it is. I believe good design should be simple and clear with a pragmatic focus on business growth.
